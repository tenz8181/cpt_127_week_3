# Objective: Write a program that takes a list of numbers and prints out the sum, average, and largest number in the list.



# Problem 1: Write a program that takes a list of numbers and prints out the sum of all the numbers in the list.
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
calculate_sum(numbers)
problem 1
def calculate_average(numbers):
    average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    print("The average is:", average)


# Problem 2: Write a program that takes a list of numbers and prints out the average of all the numbers in the list.
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
calculate_average(numbers)
problem 2
def find_largest_number(numbers):
    largest_number = max(numbers)
    print("The largest number is:", largest_number)


# Problem 3: Write a program that takes a list of numbers and prints out the largest number in the list.


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
find_largest_number(numbers)
